In the investigation for Question 1, it certainly seemed to be the case that the community setting produced fewer downstream costs when
looking at the state/region level. Looking across the aggregate, by taking the sum of the cost for all hospital events and dividing by 
the number of total IsHospital=1 events, we get an average hospital downstream cost of 4033.

Looking across IsHospital=0 events, we see 89,372 events. Summing up the cost across all of those and dividing by the number of records,
we get $3,942. Community as a result is better, marginally across all regions. We know that in general hospital visits are more costly, and patients going to hospitals
for these procedures are probably incurring more costs.

As we saw in Part 1 though, region mattered a lot. OH and MI need further investigation to determine why the studies were not performing as well there,
and the other states in the study had a 6% savings rate for community, compared to the overall rate of (4033-3942)/4033=2.26%, and other less performing states
had hospitals actually being slightly lower in cost, but the savings was really not statistically significant. I have placed another copy of
CommunityVersusHospital.csv in the Question 4 folder to show this, and the overall rate was just a simple calculation above.
