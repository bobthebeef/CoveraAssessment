In general, it appears that overall the community settings, defined as IsHospital=0 and no other qualifiers, 
downstream costs are lower in the community settings (This is also my answer for number 4, but will respond in turn there when I get to it).

Regionally, there do appear to be some differences (see CommunityversusHospital.csv), we see about a 6% savings across non-unknown states 
(marginal amount of data that had a zip code that didn't map back to a state in my source of truth for the zip code dimension), with the notable exception of Ohio (OH).
There are 5 known states in this data set where studies are taking place: IN,OH,FL, MI and IL.

IN, FL and IL are performing very well with over a 6% savings across these regions. MI is doing marginally better than the hospital setting,
with a 0.88 savings in the total downstream cost per event. The unknown data is too small to draw conclusions from.

From this data, I would determine that there is correlation between the geographical areas of OH and MI that indicate that 
the community settings there are not performing as well as hospitals, and use that as a springboard for deeper investigation as to why.
For example, patient age could play a role. In this high level summary with the data available, we should direct resources towards the regions of
OH and MI to determine why the community setting is not producing the roughly 6.6% savings that IN,IL and FL are producing.
