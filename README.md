# CoveraAssessment
Data Challenge Project for Covera

See Setup.sql for data cleansing work

See Analysis.sql for analysis into the freshly cleansed data in progress
Comments exist in 

There is a folder for each question:
Questions 1,2,3 and 4 folders contain outputted data and my answers to the question on the assessment exist in a file called Results.txt in each questions folder. 

Assumptions were made and documented in Setup.sql for the data cleansing work. Based on those assumptions, I cleaned up the data, discovered that the file appeared to be effective in the year 2018, and was able to fill in data for age and patient birth year as a result. Since I didn't know the exact birth date of each patient in the data, age is an estimate, each patient should have been the age listed at some point in calendar year 2018. In a real world scenario, I would of course check with stakeholders and try to get additional justification for data cleansing before making assumptions. The assumptions made influenced my downstream results.


I was able to make some interesting discoveries with this project! Thank you for the opportunity to take this excercise. Maria told me on the call that I'd probably find it fun, and I did. It is a great assessment. Thank you for the opportunity and I look forward to hearing back from Maria soon.
