High BMI does not correlate with repeat imaging. I got a minor issue that I didn't resolve with BMI, I think it has to do with typecasting
around the join using the BETWEEN operator, but the BETWEEN operator SHOULD BE inclusive, so there is an issue there that I ignored as it was a small
amount of data, 94 rows total out of 7,194 total patients that had 2 study events.

Age, surprisingly, also does not appear to be correlative. While more patients over age 70 appeared for a repeat image, there was also a LOT more patients over the age of 70 in the study.
I looked at the total number of patients who appeared for a repeat image in each age group, divided by the total number of patients and multipled by 100 to see a weighted score by age
Across all age groups, roughly 3.4-3.6% of patients appeared for a repeat image.

See PatientsByBMI and PatientsByAge csv's in the Question 2 folder for the data output.

State appears to be highly correlative. Here we find that OH, which was identified as a problem area in question 1, also has the greatest number of repeats as a percentage of the total study events.
OH has the hughest number of raw repeats by state as well. I would really want to dig into what's going on in OH, as they seem to be an area where the community setting is not much better than the 
hospital setting, and that would be concerning in a real world scenario.

These results can be found in the RepeatsByState.csv
