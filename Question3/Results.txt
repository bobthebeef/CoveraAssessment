As with the previous question, a patient's BMI does not appear to have a statistically significant correlation to ER visits. There
also appear to be only a handful of overweight patients, (114/39,237 in the ER data set), so no conclusions can be drawn from BMI which
combines height and weight.

By state, I looked at the percentage on ErEvents, defined as where the study performed at the ER was true in the data.
Looking at the total ErEvents compared to all of the events total IL,OH and IN seemed to all have around 14.8% of their total statewide events
taking place in the ER. FL and MI ranked higher when looking by state, having a little more than twice the rate of ER visits as a %
of all total visits, coming in at around 32.8% for FL and 32.9% or MI. There seems to be a correlation between MI and FL having more ER
visits, and I would suggest more investigation from data scientists and or my team of data analysts as to why if presented with this.
There could be confounding factors, like age, which I will analyze next. The results are available in ErEventsByState.csv

Looking at only ERImaging events across age groups and across states, it's fairly consistent to find that a larger percentage of patients
using the ER for care across all states is relatively consistent in the 30-35% range for the 70+ age cohort. 34.1% for FL,39.1% in unmappable zips,
34.7% in OH, 34.2% in MI, 31.9% in IL and 34.1% in IN. See ErEventsByAgeState.csv.

Looking at the total number of patients in the study by age alone, we find that the total number of patients compared to the number of Er Events is
roughly consistent, around 20% of visits across all age cohorts were ER events. So it doesn't look like age alone correlates with the number of events,
so really the strongest correlation here is by state, and in this case it seems like there is something going on in FL and MI compared
to the other states in the study. The biggest concern seeing this data would be to figure out what might be causing this, between the practices done
in the other states. Ohio is off the hook for this one! MI and IN are leading the pack in ER visits, and we should get ER visits down as
ER costs are very expensive. Interventions to help patients seek these procedures in community settings in MI and IL are in order.
